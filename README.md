Tips to working with git and github

Hello! My name is Emma Staut.

I'm studying mathematics and data science, which is a fancy way of saying  I make spreadsheets for fun.

Throughout the last few months, I've been learning how to use R and Python, playing the viola in my school's orchestra, and learning about number theory in my math classes.

When I organize my work, I first write everything out in my scratch notebook, break my work down into tasks which I can check off in a to-do list, and document my work along the way.
Hello I am Vai. I am in IE major.
